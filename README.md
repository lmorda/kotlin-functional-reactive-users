## Spring Fu 

Spring Fu is an incubator for Jafu (Java DSL) and Kofu (Kotlin DSL) designed to configure Spring Boot explicitly with code in a declarative way with great discoverability thanks to auto-complete. It provides fast startup (40% faster than regular auto-configuration on a minimal Spring MVC app), low memory consumption and is a good fit with GraalVM native thanks to its (almost) reflection-less approach.
